# Commercial License (Template & Instructions)

This project is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3) by default. If you wish to use the project in a commercial product or under terms that differ from GPLv3, you must obtain a separate commercial license from the copyright holder.

How to obtain a commercial license

1. Open a new issue in this repository using the provided template: [Create Commercial License Request](https://github.com/BOHUYESHAN-APB/N-T-AI/issues/new/choose) and select "Commercial License Request" (or click New Issue → Commercial License Request). Include your intended usage scenario (distribution model, whether you will redistribute modified binaries, expected user base, expected deployment scale, and contact information).
2. Provide the intended usage scenario (distribution model, whether you will redistribute modified binaries, expected user base, expected deployment scale, and your legal entity name).
3. We will respond on the Issue with a proposed commercial license offer that includes scope, fees, payment terms, and any special clauses (support, warranty, source access). After mutual agreement we will issue a signed Commercial License Agreement.

Suggested information to include in the Issue (the repository provides an Issue template to help):

- Company / Entity name
- Contact person and email
- Intended use (product name, distribution channel)
- Whether you will redistribute modified or unmodified binaries
- Estimated monthly active users or deployments
- Required license duration (perpetual / time-limited)
- Any additional requests (source access, indemnity, priority support)

Processing: We will normally respond within 5 business days. The Issue will be used to track negotiation; once terms are agreed the repository owner will attach a PDF of the signed license and close the Issue.

Notes

- If your goal is to completely forbid any commercial use by third parties, consider using a non-commercial license (for example, a Creative Commons NC license). That will prevent others from using the code commercially but also limits contributors and tooling compatibility.
- Dual-licensing (GPLv3 for open source + separate commercial license for paying customers) is a common approach that allows community collaboration while preserving commercial revenue streams.

Replace placeholders (COPYRIGHT HOLDER, CONTACT_EMAIL, PROJECT NAME) with actual values.
