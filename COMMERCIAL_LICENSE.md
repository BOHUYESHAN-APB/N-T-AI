Notes

- If your goal is to completely forbid any commercial use by third parties, consider using a non-commercial license (for example, a Creative Commons NC license). That will prevent others from using the code commercially but also limits contributors and tooling compatibility.
- Dual-licensing (GPLv3 for open source + separate commercial license for paying customers) is a common approach that allows community collaboration while preserving commercial revenue streams.

Replace placeholders (COPYRIGHT HOLDER, CONTACT_EMAIL, PROJECT NAME) with actual values.
